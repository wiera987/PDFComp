## Background

There are tools that automatically compare the differences between two PDF files, but you can't detect the difference well unless they are almost the same text.
When comparing PDF files with a revised paragraph structure, the pages you want are not compared and you need to specify the pages again.
This PDFComp is an application that specializes in manual operation and allows you to quickly move pages and check one page at a time.

As it is an experimental project so far, it has only the minimum required functionality.
